# 05-FPS-Maze
Project 05 for C220. November 20th, 2021.

A First Person Maze for class C220. There were a ton of technical issues and rather than try to implement features that wouldn't work or allow the game to work, I left them out as I felt there was no point in including features that would cause the overall game not to work.

## Implementation
There is an enemy, although there is some problem with the collision due to to technical errors while following the demo videos that I could not fix or figure out and didn't have the time to ask, Music that was written by me (doesn't loop as i thought it did by default but it does not), sound effects for the exit, enemy, and key, Procedural Generation on the maze, a player that can be controlled. There is an in game menu that allows them to restart or quit the game. There is no starting game menu or ending game menu as there were coding errors that I could not fix as I was follwing the instructions. Specifcally on line 18 so i reverted the scrip to implement the in game menu. Added basic tile materials.
